ESLint Brief Report:

STEPS:

After creating my folder and initalizing npm i used the command `npm init @eslint/config`

Afterwards my options were as follows:

`√ How would you like to use ESLint? · style`

`√ What type of modules does your project use? · esm`

`√ Which framework does your project use? · none`

`√ Does your project use TypeScript? · No`

`√ Where does your code run? · browser`

`√ How would you like to define a style for your project? · guide`

`√ Which style guide do you want to follow? · standard`

`√ What format do you want your config file to be in? · JavaScript` 

I noticed that for the 'where does your code' run part there was a node option but wasnt selectable, not sure why?

Then came these options:

`√ Would you like to install them now? · Yes`

`√ Which package manager do you want to use? · npm`

And the necessary files and packages were installed without issues

I also made the necessary changes to the .eslintrc.js file to modify the rules section 
and added the optional 'semistandard'

ESLint is a great way to maintain code quality, i made some changes to yourfile.js to test this 
and the results were very specific on what to change whether it was an error or a warning. This will ensure that 
files are created with the right coding standards and maintain a level of professionalism when creating files.
